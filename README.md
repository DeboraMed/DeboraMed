## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹ 

### About Me
Iâ€™m a passionate web developer and UI/UX designer who loves creating exceptional digital experiences. My focus is on UI/UX, which means I care not only about how a website looks but also about how it feels to use.

### My Skills
**Front-end:** I have experience with React, Angular, and Vue, and I can build interactive and visually appealing user interfaces.
**Accessibility:** I believe in making the web accessible to everyone. I always consider accessibility best practices in my designs and development.
**Design:** Iâ€™m passionate about clean and functional design. I follow design principles and strive for visual harmony in every project.
**Languages:** Iâ€™m fluent in JavaScript and TypeScript, and I can write HTML and CSS with my eyes closed.
**Back-end:** I have knowledge of Spring Boot and Laravel, which allows me to understand the entire application lifecycle.
**Deployment:** Iâ€™ve worked with Docker for efficient application deployment.
**APIs:** I can create robust and scalable APIs to connect applications.
**Lifelong Learner**
Despite having experience, Iâ€™m always learning and exploring new technologies. I believe continuous learning is essential to stay up-to-date in this ever-evolving field.
