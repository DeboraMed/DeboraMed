# Hello! 👋 I'm Debora

## 🌟 Crafting Exceptional Digital Experiences 🌟

As a passionate **web developer** and **UI/UX designer**, my mission is to transform ideas into beautiful, functional interfaces. I thrive at the intersection of code and design, and here's what I bring to the table:

### 💡 User-Centered Design
It's not just about colors and shapes. I create experiences that make users smile. How? By considering **accessibility**, **usability**, and **intuition** in every detail.

### 🚀 My Tech Stack
- **Front-end**: React, Angular, and Vue. I love building interactive, visually appealing user interfaces.
- **Back-end**: Spring Boot and Laravel. I understand the entire application lifecycle.
- **Deployment**: Docker. I efficiently deploy applications.
- **APIs**: I create robust connections between applications.

### 🎨 Clean and Functional Design
Following **design best practices**, I seek visual harmony in every project. It's not just about looking good; it's about seamless functionality.

### 🌱 Lifelong Learner
Despite my experience, I'm always exploring new technologies. The digital world evolves rapidly, and so do I. 📚
